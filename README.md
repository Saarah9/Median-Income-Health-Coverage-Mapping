# US States Data Visualization and Analysis
This project provides a comprehensive analysis and visualization of socio-economic data across US states, including median household income, educational attainment, and health insurance coverage.
## Overview
This project visualizes and analyzes US state-level data, including:
* Median household income
* Educational attainment (population with a bachelor's degree or higher)
* Health insurance coverage rates

Using geospatial data and Python libraries, the analysis provides insights into socio-economic disparities across states.

## Features
* Geospatial Analysis: Leverages shapefiles to map data visually.
* Categorical Insights: Categorizes states by population, income, and health insurance coverage.
* Interactive Visualizations: Creates color-coded maps using matplotlib and geopandas.
* Data Integration: Combines multiple datasets into a unified view for analysis.

## Usage
Steps to Run
* Place the necessary data files in the root directory:
1. shapefile/ (folder containing US states shapefile)
2. Median household income.xlsx
3. Educational Attainment.xlsx
4. Health Insurance.xlsx
